ESOF - First Report
===================

Introduction
-------------
Elasticsearch is a distributed, document-oriented search server based on the open-source information retrieval library Lucene. It's currently the second most used search engine only behind Apache Solr, another search platform based on Lucene.

Elasticsearch is one of its company's (Elastic) 3 big open source projects alongside Logstash and Kibana.

Project Activity
----------------
As of the time of writing, Elasticsearch has 16,298 commits, 55 branches, 132 releases and 524 contributors.
There are currently 1,104 open issues, 7,290 closed ones, 168 open pull requests and 5,345 closed ones.

Project Methodology
-------------------
Elasticsearch employs a development model similar to other open source projects, in which a large number of motivated developers all over the world contribute on the features they want implemented. As such, there is no clear precedence in the various tasks that are undertaken, resulting in a great degree of concurrency in the project, thus diverging greatly from the waterfall model. 

In contrast, the constant adding of new features, pushed exclusively by the users of the software, and the ever expanding requirements for increasingly complex use cases, originating from large and small clients alike, invariably drive the developers to rethink and restructure both their software and their understanding of the problem at hand, bringing the project more in line with more modern agile methodologies, despite the lack of the element of co-location.

Its nature as a distributed piece of software mandates a high level of control and correctness in the program, and the developers fulfill this requirement with a comprehensive suite of tests each patch must pass in order to be accepted and integrated. It does not, however, fit into a test-driven paradigm as tests are not required to be written first. The frequent release of new versions, be they of release candidates or full numbered versions, materialize the aspect of incremental delivery within agile.

Unlike most other open source projects, their resources allow them to meet in person a few times a year, which allows for a higher degree of coordination and focus, in addition to the stand-up meetings taking place 3 times weekly, akin to those of scrum, though less frequent. 

This agile paradigm allows the developers to stay invested in the project while empowering them with the flexibility to shape it to meet the diverse needs of a fast growing market that now includes some of the biggest software companies in the world such as Facebook.
